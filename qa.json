    "question": "How can Serri help my EdTech business increase student conversions?",
    "answer": "Serri can help increase your student conversions through several methods.

    "question": "We already use email marketing for our courses. Why should we switch to WhatsApp?",
    "answer": "Great question! While email marketing works for some businesses, WhatsApp offers significantly higher engagement rates for EdTech specifically. Our clients in the education sector see 75% response rates on WhatsApp Forms versus just 15% for email surveys. For course updates and reminders, WhatsApp messages are typically read within minutes, ensuring students don't miss important class schedules or assignment deadlines. EdTech companies like PrepLeaf have automated their entire lead follow-up process through WhatsApp, which enabled them to onboard more than 1,000 students without writing a single line of code. Additionally, WhatsApp's familiarity and widespread usage in India makes it the ideal channel for communicating with students who might ignore emails but regularly check WhatsApp. Would you like to see how our WhatsApp automation compares to your current email engagement rates?"

    "question": "What's the pricing structure for Serri? We're a bootstrapped EdTech startup.",
    "answer": "I understand budget constraints are important for bootstrapped EdTech startups. Serri offers flexible pricing plans starting at just ₹999 per month, designed to be accessible for businesses of all sizes. Our plans scale based on your requirements and growth, so you only pay for what you need. Many of our EdTech clients start with a basic plan and upgrade as they see ROI.

    "question": "Can you share some specific examples of how other EdTech companies have used Serri successfully?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! PrepLeaf, an EdTech company, used Serri's chatbots to onboard more than 1,000 students without writing a single line of code. Their team described it as having a 24/7 sales team. SIPWay School scaled to 500+ students in just 1 month using our automated reminder features, and 25% of their growth came from our referral program capabilities. Another example is YP Club, which automated all their lead follow-ups with Serri, increasing their ROI 5 times in just 3 months. Our clients in the EdTech space typically see 30% lower customer acquisition costs via AI-driven lead qualification, 20% higher course completion rates with our automated reminders, and 40% faster payment processing using WhatsApp Pay. For example, one coding bootcamp used our AI Chatbots to answer common questions like 'How do I access course materials?' resulting in 70% fewer support tickets, allowing their instructors to focus on teaching rather than administration. Would you like to hear more specific details about any of these case studies?"
