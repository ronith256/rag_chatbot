### Question 1: How can Serri help my EdTech business increase student conversions?

**Generated Answer:**

Serri can help your EdTech business increase student conversions by leveraging AI-powered automation and WhatsApp integration to optimize the student journey. Here are some ways Serri can help: 

1. **Awareness**: Attract prospective students with Click-to-WhatsApp Ads (CTWA), which redirect users from ads on platforms like Google, Meta, and YouTube to WhatsApp chats. For example, "Interested in our coding boot camp? Chat now for a free syllabus!" This approach can result in 3X higher CTR vs. landing pages and 76% lower cost per lead.  
2. **Consideration**: Qualify and nurture leads using WhatsApp broadcast campaigns, sending bulk messages to cold audiences highlighting course benefits. For instance, "Join 10,000+ learners! Explore AI courses starting at $99." This can help 30% lower CAC via AI-driven lead qualification.  
3. **Application**: Automate reminders and payment processing using WhatsApp Pay Integration, enabling 40% faster payment processing and 5X ROI for EdTechs like PrepLeaf and SIPWay School.  
4. **Post-Sales Engagement**: Utilize AI Chatbots to provide support and engage with students post-enrollment, ensuring a seamless customer experience and reducing support queries. 

To achieve these results, Serri's AI growth engine combines the power of WhatsApp, AI, and automation to streamline the student journey. By leveraging these capabilities, EdTech businesses can increase student conversions and drive revenue growth. Would you like to schedule a demo to see how Serri can help your EdTech business?

### Question 2: We already use email marketing for our courses. Why should we switch to WhatsApp?

**Generated Answer:**

Many businesses, like yours, have successfully used email marketing for their courses. However, WhatsApp offers several advantages that can enhance your marketing efforts and lead to better results. Did you know that 79% of businesses that use WhatsApp for marketing see a higher engagement rate compared to email marketing? This is because WhatsApp is a more personal and direct channel, allowing you to connect with your audience in real-time. Here are a few reasons why you might consider switching to WhatsApp:

1. **Higher Open Rates**: WhatsApp has an average open rate of 98%, compared to email's 22%. This means that your messages are more likely to be seen by your audience.  
2. **Better Engagement**: WhatsApp allows for two-way conversations, enabling you to engage with your audience and build relationships. This leads to higher conversion rates and customer loyalty.  
3. **Increased Conversion**: WhatsApp's click-through rate (CTR) is 3 times higher than email's CTR. This means that more people are likely to take action on your messages.  
4. **Cost-Effective**: WhatsApp is a cost-effective channel, especially when compared to traditional advertising methods. You can reach your audience without incurring high costs.  
5. **Measurable Results**: WhatsApp provides measurable results, allowing you to track your performance and make data-driven decisions.

Many businesses have successfully switched to WhatsApp and seen significant improvements in their marketing efforts. For example, PrepLeaf, an EdTech company, saw a 5X ROI by using WhatsApp for their marketing campaigns.
